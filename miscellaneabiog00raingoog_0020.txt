os “ oulde angells'' offered by our friend above to supply
the deficiency, ue should be uusueeessful, asne know of
110 other copy of the manuscript.

A third Poetioal Life (the Irish Life in verse) has
been mentioned above, and a fourth is preserved in one
of the manuscripts bequeathed by Sir Mattheu Hale to
the Library of Linooln’s Inn.

The transcript of the Life now printed was obligingly
made sor the Society by Mr Henry Turner, one of it
members 3 and the respeetful thanks of the Society are
due to the Master and Fellows os University College
for the loan of the manuscript sor this purpose.

IV. The short Life os Rata, Bishop of Hexham, is
contained in the York manuscript abore mentioned, and
as it is materially different from the Life os this prelate

printed in Capgrave, it has been thought worthy of a
placeio these pagos. Capgrave’s Lires are in fact mere
abridgments, and in some instantes his anxiety sor com-
pression has led him to reject matter of importance.
