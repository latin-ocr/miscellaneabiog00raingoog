is printed from a manuscript cf the fourteenth century
belonging to the Dean and Chapter of York‚ of which a
minute account will be given in the Preface to the Three
Durham Historiam, Coldingham, Graystanes, and
Chambre, which are now engaging the attention of the

Society. This piece of Biography has, as a whole,
never been printed before. The Life of Cuthbert in
Capgrave, which is a conflation from various sources
commences with the Irish origin of the saint, as detailed
in the Life before us3 and Coglan, apparently following Ι

Capgrave‚ has ascribed to him the same royal origin.
The Editor of the Life of Cuthbert, in the Acri Snwc-
nonum (March 20), enters fully into the apparent ana· .
- chronisms and contradictione of the whole narrative as
we give itin the following pegae, and rejects it as fabu-
lous‚ “Certe'' says he, “Baeda nollet illustri suo
purpureo operi hos laceros assui pannOS,'' upon observing
the silence of Bede respecting the alledged royal descent
of the Saint, and thus concludes his remarks: “servent
Hiberni suum Nullnhoc ejulantem et relinquant Anglo-
Senonibus Cuthbertum.'' This life, however, comes
within the plens of the Surtees Society asa regular
piece of biography, written in a good style, and not de·
ficient in incidental information upon subjecte connected
with the period in which it was written, and these con·
siderations have led to its publication.

It must be remarked that the Monks of Durham had
some belief in this Irish descent of Cuthbert, and in
“ other circumstances in his history detailed in this piece

of biography. This is proved by the following extract
