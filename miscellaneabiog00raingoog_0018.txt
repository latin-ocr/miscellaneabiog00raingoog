The subject of every chapter is delineatod in an ele-
Α gant illuminatiou.

The Poem stands last in the Volume‚ and has no em·
bellishment save the initial O in ‘⁴ Ο Pater Anglorum.”
’ The initial letter of each line has boen added in eolour
by a second hand. ln some instances the initial has

boen inserted by the original hand, and when this is the
case a letter is redundant.

The MS. itself contains the autographs of its different

owners at various periods‚ until it became the property
os the Collega.
