⁴ There is, in the British Museum,(T1rus, Α. ΙΙ. Q.
3.) another copy of this Irish Life ol Cuthbert, as it
hasbeen called, with a translation into Leonine verse.
The latter begins with the following lines :—

“ Si cupis audire, Cuthberti miraquescire
Virtutis mirae, potes hunc sanctum reperire.
Sanctus Cuthbertus Anglorum tutor apertus
Regis erat natus et Hybernicus est generatus, &o.’'

The Poem, however, is imperfect. A note at the
loot os sol. 151. b. discluses this defect, and expresses
the great anxiety of its owner on the subject. “ Hear
wants fyve leaves, for whiche Iwold gev fyve oulde
angells.'' The Poem ends as follows :—

“ Dum precibus caris devotus eum veneraris. ’
Terras Cuthberti qui non spoliare verentur,
Esse queant certi quod morte rnala mor·ientur.”

There appears to be another copy of this same Poeti-
cal Life in the MS. Harl. 4843, f. 961.

Ill. The next piece, the Lite of St. Cuthbert in sirn-
ple LeonineS,* is transcribed frorn a manuscript [l. tl.
165] belonging to the Master and Fellows of University
Collega Oxford, written about the end ol the thh or

beginning of the rath century, and containing, besides,
l. Bede's Prose Life of st. Cuthbert.
