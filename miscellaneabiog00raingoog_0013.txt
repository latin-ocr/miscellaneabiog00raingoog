110 Cells or dependent MonasterieS, in order to repent
at leisure of his sins, and prosecute his literary designa
(p. 39-40). He seems to have taken up his abode at
Tynemouth in the year 1111, for he was resident there
on the aand of September in that year (p. Q8), and it
does not appear that he was present at the Translation 01
00010, which took place in the year preceding. Whilst
resident at Tynemouth he was attached with the gout,
and we should have known nothing of his sufferings un·
der this disease, had he not believed it to have been re-
moved by the miraculous interference of his patron St.
Oswin. He brings his history down to the reign 01
Stephen, and therefore he must have lived to a con·
siderable age.

from Bede.

His style is pleasing, and he enters with considerable
vigam, and occasionally with humour, into some of his
10100, and details many very curious historical circum·
stances and local events, which but for him would have
been buried in oblivion.

A pleasing memorial of the piety 01 King Oswin, the
subject 01 this memoir, is preserved 10 the British Mu-
seum among the Cotton. MSS. (Galba A. 5.) aPsalter‚
which before the fire in 1731, when it was much injured,
contained the inscription “Liber Oswini Regis.'' From
the portions which remain it seems 10 belong to Oswin's ,
period. It is 01 the duodecimo sire, and therefore the

Ἴ more adapted to daily use.
